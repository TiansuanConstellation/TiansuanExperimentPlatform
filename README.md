[Tiansuan Constellation](http://www.tiansuan.org.cn/index.html) is an open satellite research platform. It is divided into three phases, the first phase with 6 satellites, the second phase with 24 satellites, and the third phase with 300 satellites. This open research platform would enable the global academic community to conduct experiments on real satellites and evaluate practical solutions.

Yet, the high entry barriers, substantial costs, and numerous uncertainties in space technology prevent many eager institutions and companies from addressing critical development and survival issues for humanity. 
At Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), we contemplate our potential contributions to human progress. We welcome more members to join us in forwarding satellite technology and tackling these challenges together. Our goal is to establish the Tiansuan Constellation, an open service platform for in-orbit experiments. The Tiansuan Constellation aims to benefit humanity, target the forefront of research and international leadership, promote open-source culture and adhere an collaboration model between industry and academia.

In order to further promote the development and innovation in the field of satellite computing, we have built an experimental platform. **Tiansuan experiment platform** relies on the infrastructure of Tiansuan Constellation, provides convenient and efficient services, and optimizes the collaborative process of conducting experiments. By leveraging this platform, we hope to bring together innovation solutions. All the members are welcome to join us in creating a bright future of satellite computing.

## Advantages
At present, Tiansuan Constellation has several satellites in orbit. We have established cooperative relations with numerous universities including Tsinghua, Peking, Beihang University and so on. We have successfully carried [many research projects on satellites](http://www.tiansuan.org.cn/morenews.html).

For those looking to conduct experiments using real satellites, we offer a straightforward and easy-to-use application process. Applicants can:

1. Learn the basic information about the Tiansuan Experiment Platform.
2. Explain the details of their project in a few simple steps and submit their code to us.
3. Have their code deployed on actual satellites by us, based on the provided documentation.
4. Await the completion of the run, after which we will provide the final results and data.


## How to Make Experiment Proposal

If you would like to conduct experiments, please visit [Tiansuan Experiment Platform website](http://tle.tiansuan.site/). Before you go, here are several steps you would like to follow:

1. Read the [User Agreement](./TERMS.md) of Tiansuan Experiment Platform. Make sure not to have any conflict of interest.
2. Go through the [Specifications](./Specifications.md) of our satellites. Currently, BUPT-1 is available in orbit. We also plan to launch BUPT-2/3 in 2024.
3. Perpare the documents and codes for the experiments. For the documents, we provide the [Application Template](./Application.md) for reference.
4. Go to the [Tiansuan Experiment Platform website](http://tle.tiansuan.site/). You can submit the documents and code there.
5. If you have any issue or question, feel free to contact us at buptts@163.com, and CC to xrl@bupt.edu.cn.

Tiansuan Constellation welcomes individuals, organizations and insitutions dedicated to sateliite research. Feel free to contact us, share your cool ideas and together we'll make a better future!
